Project guidance for AI assistants working with this repository.

## Project Goal

Create the simplest possible introduction to using Python with AI assistance. Target audience: Complete beginners who need to solve real data problems at work.

## Core Principles

1. **Speed over depth** - Users should be productive in 1 hour
2. **Action over theory** - Show what to do, not why
3. **Real over abstract** - Use actual work examples
4. **Simple over complete** - Cover 80% of needs with 20% of complexity

## Style Guide

### Writing
- **Ultra-concise** - Every word must earn its place
- **Direct commands** - "Do this" not "You should do this"
- **No fluff** - Skip pleasantries, introductions, conclusions
- **Code comments** - Explain concepts inline, not in paragraphs
- **One emoji max** - Only if it adds clarity (like Python ❤️ AI)

### Structure
- **Clear headers** - Users scan, not read
- **Short sections** - One concept per section
- **Practical examples** - Real scenarios, not foo/bar
- **Quick reference style** - Lists and code blocks dominate

### Code
```python
# Comments explain the concept right here
name = "John"    # This style, not paragraphs above
```

## Document Purposes

### Core Path (1 hour total)
1. **first-steps.md** - Install uv and create project (10 min)
2. **editors.md** - VSCode setup (10 min)
3. **the-basics.md** - Recognize Python patterns (10 min)
4. **how-to-use-with-ai.md** - Core skill: AI collaboration (20 min)
5. **starting-prompt.md** - Template for AI conversations (10 min)

### Supporting Docs
- **about-uv.md** - Why uv instead of traditional Python
- **advanced-uv.md** - Command reference for later
- **learning-checklist.md** - Self-paced skill progression
- **additional-tools-and-resources.md** - Next steps when ready

### Special
- **credential-engine.md** - Specific guidance for CE team

## What NOT to Do

- Don't explain programming concepts in depth
- Don't add "why" sections unless critical for understanding
- Don't write verbose explanations
- Don't add multiple navigation links
- Don't use emoji decorations
- Don't create new documents unless essential

## Key Messages

1. You're not learning to program, you're learning to direct AI
2. Python is just the language AI speaks best
3. Errors are normal, AI helps fix them
4. Start working immediately, learn by doing

## Technical Choices

- **uv** - Fastest, simplest Python management
- **VSCode** - Free, popular, AI understands it
- **Windows 11** - Primary target platform
- **PowerShell** - Default terminal

## Success Metrics

User can:
1. Install everything in 30 minutes
2. Run first script in 45 minutes
3. Solve a real problem in 2 hours
4. Feel confident asking AI for help

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep all examples Windows-compatible
- Test commands before documenting
- Update package lists quarterly
- Maintain Custom GPT alignment with prompts

## Remember

This isn't a programming tutorial. It's a guide to getting work done with AI assistance. Every decision should optimize for speed to productivity, not depth of understanding.
