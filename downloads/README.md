# Downloads

Files downloaded by the bootstrap script to your starter project.

These files are automatically downloaded from this repo when you run the bootstrap script. They provide:

1. **Working examples** of pandas, requests, beautifulsoup4, pydantic, and file operations
2. **Sample data** to practice with immediately  
3. **Tutorial-style comments** explaining each concept

The bootstrap script places these in your project root with a `example-data/` folder for outputs.
