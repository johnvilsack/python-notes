# Working with AI to Get Code

## The Basic Loop

1. **Tell AI what you want**
2. **Get Python code**
3. **Run it**
4. **Fix issues with AI's help**
   1. Explain outcome
   2. Paste screen output
   3. Share error messages
5. **Iterate until it works**

## How to Ask for Code

### Good Request Structure
1. `I need a Python script that can...`
2. Explain what you expect it will do -or- what you are trying to solve.
3. Describe what you have
4. Describe what you need
5. Describe what the result will be
6. `Please provide a solution using well-documented Python code`


### Real Examples

**Example 1: File Processing**
```
I need a Python script that reads a CSV file and finds all rows where the date is last Monday.

Input: CSV file with columns: Date, Name, Amount, Status
Output: New CSV with only Monday's rows

Please use well-documented Python code.
```

**Example 2: Web Scraping**
```
I need a Python script that checks these 5 websites and tells me which ones mention "Red Fire Trucks".

Websites:
- https://example1.com
- https://example2.com
[etc]

Output: List showing each URL and whether it contains the phrase

Please use well-documented Python code.
```

## When AI Gives You Code

1. **Save it as main.py**
2. **Check the top of the script for new imports**
3. **Install any missing packages**:
   ```bash
   uv add <package-name-here>
   ```
4. **Run it**:
   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

## Handling Errors

### Share the Exact Error

Copy the ENTIRE error message to AI:

```
I got this error when running your code:

[PASTE FULL ERROR HERE]

How do I fix this?
```

### Common Issues

**Code is wrong**
- Tell AI: "The code runs but [WHAT'S WRONG]. It should [WHAT YOU EXPECTED]"

**"File not found"**
- Check file name and location
- Tell AI: "The file is actually located at [path]"

**"No module named X"**
- There's a new package importing
- Install it: `uv add <package-name-here>`
- 
## Successfully Iterating

### Be Specific About Problems

**Bad:** "It doesn't work"

**Good:** "The script runs but only finds 3 emails when I can see 10 in the file"

### Provide Context

**Bad:** "Fix this error"

**Good:** Copy and paste screen output, especially errors; Provide samples of the output that is incorrect

### Better Debugging

Ask AI to:
1. Tell AI to print verbose output for debugging
2. When troubleshooting, ask it to process only the first few lines to cut down on processing time
3. If you still have problems, ask AI to create 'Step-Through' code so you can confirm each step

## Example: Conversation Flow

**You:** "I need a script that combines all CSV files in a folder into one big CSV"

**AI:** [Provides code]

**You:** "I'm getting 'No module named pandas'"

**AI:** "Install pandas with: uv add pandas"

**You:** "Now it says 'No CSV files found'"

**AI:** "Make sure you're running from the right folder. Try adding this to see current directory..." [provides updated code]

**You:** "Perfect! It found 5 files and combined them"
