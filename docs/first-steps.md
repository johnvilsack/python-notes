# Installing Python (Windows 11)

## Installation

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**
   - Right-click Start button
   - Click "Terminal (Admin)" 
   - Click "Yes" when asked

2. **Install uv Python Manager**
   - Copy and paste this command:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```
   - Wait for "uv installed successfully"
   - Close and reopen Terminal to enable uv

## Initialize Your First Project

```powershell
# Create your project folder
cd Documents
mkdir MyPythonWork
cd MyPythonWork

# Bootstrap project
uv init

# Test it by running program - This installs Python automatically into your project!
uv run main.py
```
You should see: `Hello from hello-python!`

> Initializing a project creates all the necessary metadata files uv needs to manage your project. Each project tracks its own version of Python and the packages you need to run it. You can [learn more about uv here](about-uv.md).

## Note

You can run the install without admin privileges, but there may be issues with the `uv tool` command later.
